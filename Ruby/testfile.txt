The first parameter is the filename. The second is the mode string, which lets you open the
file for reading, writing, or both. (Here we opened testfile for reading with an "r". We could
also have used "w" for write or "r+" for read-write. The full list of allowed modes appears
on page 547.) You can also optionally specify file permissions when creating a file; see the
description of File.new on page 512 for details. After opening the file, we can work with
it, writing and/or reading data as needed. Finally, as responsible software citizens, we close
the file, ensuring that all buffered data is written and that all related resources are freed.
